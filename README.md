# ConnectFour
Final Project for COMS115 (Intro. to Computer Science II) at SCCC

My final project is a GUI game of Connect Four. It allows for two players to take turns while playing against each other across a 6x7 “board”. At the beginning of the game the players are prompted to decide whether Player 1 or 2 is red or black. Upon selecting, they are presented with an empty board with a button above each column that allows the users to drop their pieces in. When a piece is inserted into a “slot” the space is colored according to the player. Ultimately, the winner of the game is determined when four pieces of the same color are connected horizontally, vertically, or diagonally (if all of the spaces become filled without a winner then it is a draw). At the end of the game there is a prompt that asks if the players want to play again or if they want to quit the program.
